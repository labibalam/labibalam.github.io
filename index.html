          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p class="webdevskillp">I began learning Web Development, particularly HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, during summer of 2021.
             It has always been something I was passtionate about learning, so I took advantage of the spare
             time I had during the pandemic to learn something new. My goal is to become a Web Developer
             and eventually become a fullstack software developer</p>

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p class=pythonskillp>In my senior year of high school, I began my coding journey with Turing for the first time
            and I fell in love with it ever since. My teacher told us to pursue Python in post-secondary due to its vast
            applications outside of development including data analysis. During my university career, I had the opportunity
            to take a Python for Finance class that provided me with the knowledge and skills needed to conduct effective
            data analysis using Python.
